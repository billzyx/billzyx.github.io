## About me

I am a final-year Ph.D. student at the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.umb.edu/), UMass Boston, USA, advised
by Prof. [Xiaohui Liang](http://www.faculty.umb.edu/xiaohui.liang/). I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science and
Technology in 2020 from Nanjing Forestry University, China, advised by
Prof. [Ning Ye](https://it.njfu.edu.cn/szdw/20181224/i14051.html).

I'm broadly interested in deep learning and its applications, including but not limited to
**speech and language evaluation**, **deep transfer learning**, and **multi-modal learning**.
During my Ph.D., my research mainly centers around **Cognitive Assessment for Humans**. 
Specifically, I researched speech-based dementia detection, a super-human difficulty-level task that
assesses human cognition using speech and language.
I explored various techniques addressing the challenge of heterogeneity, complexity, and scarcity of dementia-related data:
- Effective transfer learning of semantic and non-semantic information ([Frontiers 2021](https://doi.org/10.3389/fcomp.2021.624683); [INTERSPEECH 2021](https://doi.org/10.21437/interspeech.2021-332)), 
- Explainable models ([ICASSP 2022](https://doi.org/10.1109/icassp43922.2022.9747006))
- Overcome lack of domain-similar data in transfer learning ([INTERSPEECH 2022](https://billzyx.github.io//files/10862_Paper.pdf)). 
- Multi-modal learning ([Multi-modal KDD 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07933))
- Large language model decoding techniques (EMNLP 2024 submission)


Moving forward, I will further explore **Cognitive Assessment for AI**,
which could possibly help humans advance towards, achieving, and ultimately harnessing artificial general intelligence(AGI).
