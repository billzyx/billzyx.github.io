## About me

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.umb.edu/), UMass Boston, USA, advised
by Prof. [Xiaohui Liang](http://www.faculty.umb.edu/xiaohui.liang/). I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science and
Technology in 2020 from Nanjing Forestry University, China, advised by
Prof. [Ning Ye](https://it.njfu.edu.cn/szdw/20181224/i14051.html).

I'm broadly interested in deep learning and its applications. My recent research agenda centered around 
**transfer learning** under the **large language model** (LLM) era, with the aim of developing and customizing
**foundation models** for various downstream tasks. 
I explored various topics under this agenda, including
- Reasoning with task relating [(EMNLP 2024)](https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.1222/), 
- Multi-modality (speech and vision language models) ([INTERSPEECH 2021](https://doi.org/10.21437/interspeech.2021-332), [Multi-modal KDD 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07933))
- Targeted training data selection ([INTERSPEECH 2022](https://www.isca-archive.org/interspeech_2022/zhu22d_interspeech.pdf))
- Interpretability ([ICASSP 2022](https://doi.org/10.1109/icassp43922.2022.9747006))
- Privacy concerns (GLOBECOM 2024)

I also dive deep into speech-based dementia detection, a superhuman-level task that requires LLM to reason about
dementia-related patterns that human experts may not know.


### News

- 01/2025: I will intern at [fixie.ai](https://fixie.ai/) this spring working on speech language models and speech generation.
- 11/2024: I gave a talk at Umass Boston CS 442/642 Cybersecurity in the Internet of Things about LLM prompt privacy protection. Check out the slide [link](https://billzyx.github.io//files/privacy_slide.pdf).
