## About me

I am a second-year Ph.D. student at [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.umb.edu/), UMass Boston, USA, advised
by Prof. [Xiaohui Liang](http://www.faculty.umb.edu/xiaohui.liang/). I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science and
Technology in 2020 from Nanjing Forestry University, China, advised by
Prof. [Ning Ye](https://it.njfu.edu.cn/szdw/20181224/i14051.html).

I'm broadly interested in deep learning and its applications, including Speech-based Health Diagnosis, Speech/Text
Classification, and Deep Transfer Learning. 
I am particularly interested in how can we build AI systems to enable
effective and reliable health diagnoses despite the heterogeneous, complex, and scarcity of data. 
My recent work has focused on dementia detection from speech, specifically: 
- Effective transfer learning of semantic and non-semantic information ([Frontiers 2021](https://doi.org/10.3389/fcomp.2021.624683); [INTERSPEECH 2021](https://doi.org/10.21437/interspeech.2021-332)), 
- Explainable models ([ICASSP 2022](https://doi.org/10.1109/icassp43922.2022.9747006))
- Overcome lack of domain-similar data in transfer learning ([INTERSPEECH 2022](https://billzyx.github.io//files/10862_Paper.pdf)).
